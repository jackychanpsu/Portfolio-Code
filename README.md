# Portfolio-Code
A few projects that I've done at Penn State in addition to a small platformer
I made as a small side project. The platformer demo files are the same exact ones as the ones 
in the unity package, and are there in case the unity package fails to operate correctly.
All assets were free and found on the unity store.
